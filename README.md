== Description ==

Easily turn WordPress into a promotions website. Allow users to sign up as “promoters” and have them post the latest and greatest promotions for everything from restaurants to hair salons.

Users are able to create promotions with titles, descriptions, images, categories and start/end dates. Promotions are only public (published) while in date and are automatically set to draft/trash once a promotion has ended. Users are also easily able to edit/delete promotions at any time via a super simple interface created with 4 shortcodes!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-promo` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Create pages for each of the following shortcodes. [promotion_profile], [submit_promotion], [edit_promotion], [view_promotion] (you have to be logged in to use these pages!)
4. Place <?php echo wpp_menu(); ?> Inside of a template. (this creates a menu with links to the above shortcodes for promoters and admins!)

== Using WP Promotions ==

To begin allowing users to use WordPress promotions they have to be a “promoter” or administrator role. Both roles will be allowed to access the shortcodes  (point 3 of installation guide).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I need help... -
Help will primarily be available on WordPress forums and on my website. If you require a custom feature for the plugin or your website I'm afraid that you will need to find someone (probably paid) to do it. Feel free to ask though, it might be an upcoming feature or something that the plugin needs!

I've found a bug! -
Awesome - well kind of. Can't squash them all! If you've found a bug that is not a security issue feel free to post it on the WordPress Forums, my website or email me! If the bug is a security issue... please be a little bit quieter and alert me by email. My thanks for anyone who reports bugs!

== Changelog ==

None yet :)!
